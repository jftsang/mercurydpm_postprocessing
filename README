This directory contains a suite of MATLAB scripts and functions that are 
useful for the post-processing of data generated by MercuryDPM (as of 
verion 1.0, February 2016).

I also have a number of test files, which are the output of simple 
MercuryDPM runs.

mercury_load_data - load .data file produced by MercuryDPM
mercury_load_ene - load .ene file produced by MercuryDPM
